It seems similar to that of the Dragonkin of old: protectors of the artefact, enders of the Great Wars. Of course, " + "I should have suspected It to be hidden in a manner as straightforward as this! fools to abandon such a place; why would they move on? It must all be linked in somehow, but time does not allow for further", "investigation.

What curiosity or purpose drives them? I didn't even have to force many of them. " + "I cannot dwell; as much as I hate to admit it, I need them for now.

I won't be wasting any of my power doing this; " + "I'll save myself for a challenge worthy of me taking a more frontal role.

I will have to work on re-awakening my lost power. While my mighty slumber restored a large amount of power, " + "it was once again lost in my great search for this place. Evading detection required some interesting methods and many disguises, which has again left me drained. I have faith. In time, my full power will return once more and, " + "when", "it does, I shall break through the world with such a fury as to make Him proud. Praise be to Zamorak!"),

To think they looked down on me and doubted the extent of my power! Pathetic. Zemouregal, if he could only see me now, he would not be so quick to judge my abilities. " + "I have no doubt that he'll be wasting his time on some lost cause for power that he'll never obtain.

Someone or something has created this place as some sort of safeguard. Sometimes, when I use my magic to carve through, the areas behind collapse and reappear elsewhere.

Recently, many of my servants were cut off - they said the dungeon I'd forged had a different layout from when they left.", "On the topic of servants, they are more frailthan I feared. The giants last longer, but they can no longer fit into the small tunnels their human counterparts dig. I'll just slay them all and use their meat to feed the other slaves. " + "Hah! How I do amuse myself so! Zamorak be praised!"),
	BILPART8(15715, 241, 58, "Mysterious chronicle (part 8)", "Year 1403 of the 4th Age: <br> It turns out that I was right: the area above has begun to cool to freezing. My servants are moving deeper with me; it was pleasant to see them do it voluntarily for a change. Perhaps they believe themselves to be with me in this great descent? Ha! They'll last as long as their use permits, and they'll follow me deeper if they want to survive. As if I'd stop to maintain an area for them to live in! <br> ", "Zamorak be praised!"),

Why they insist on sleeping and eating once or twice a week irritates me to no end. They leave me no choice but to mate them up and breed new offspring to continue my journey. " + "The depth I have reached is of a different potency to the above. The rock and heat are suitable for simple beings to survive. Obviously a powerful being such as myself", "has no problem moving on, " + "but this would probably be the best depth for my slaves to settle so they can serve me more effectively. For my purposes only, I will slow my progress to extend a hand in helping them set up. " + "They'll make up for this later. Zamorak be praised!"),

To think I didn't have to lift a hand in the end. <br> " + "Today, I hear of a mass exodus, all moving down to this depth.

A working chain of production has been created amongst my slaves. The digging should be far more efficient and, " + "more importantly, I have a solid rearguard if any choose to come after me. As if anyone would try to follow in my footsteps now! On the subject of slaves, I've had great success in my breeding program. " + "I've taken", "the strength of the giants, the skin of the goblin and the size and basic intelligence of a human, and created a barely adequate but much-improved slave. Conditioning has sped up progress also. " + "I've even bred them to believe pain is good for them! They'll literally work until they drop dead where they are! Zamorak be praised!"),

Four-hundred years of careful destruction and here I am, nearing the half-way mark! If I can make it half-way, " + "I can make it all the way. I swear my power increases the deeper I go. It will not be long before I unleash on this earth. I will be closer to the end than the start. <br> Soon, I will be at the Rift!"),

I see now why He chose me as his second in command. " + "If the creation and summoning of the mighty Tsutsaroth demon for Him wasn't a sign that I am worthy of that title, what I am doing now will be. None of the others dare to do this; none of the others have power to do this; " + "none of the others have the focus to", "do this. They settle for scrabbling around with what is left and they will be punished for their lack of faith. Curious, I still feel the presence of K'ril in this realm... Zamorak be praised!"),
	BILPART17(15724, 250, 40, "Mysterious chronicle (part 17)", "Year 1693 of the 4th Age: <br> It turns out that I have been rewarded for my time creating the area above for my workers to inhabit, as it will serve as a powerful hub to the surface and help speed my progress. " + "Even so, the fact that they fear the depth below is a concern. Thankfully, I can force a lot of the cowards, but I fear it won't be enough to make quick progress.

I quashed this before it had a chance. Two treacherous fools dared attack me? History will mark this day: " + "the day Astea Frostweb and Lexicus Runewright were enslaved by the mighty Bilrach and split for all eternity. They thought their combined magical ability could stand up to me? Small-minded fools! " + "They will never be together again and", "will serve my purpose as guards of my great dungeon forever. There will be no further uprisings after that demonstration. <br> Zamorak be praised!"),
	BILPART19(19676, 252, 36, "Mysterious chronicle (part 19)", "Year 1730 of the 4th Age: <br> A new depth has been reached and it is weak to my magic. Using portal magic should be safe enough here. If the portal network is successful, I can not only dump our waste and effluence into another realm, " + "but I can search for powerful creatures to enslave and defend my great work here. Zamorak be praised!"),

Portal magic was the best move I could have made, and it has reinvigorated my enthusiasm for this project. Not only am I able to draw power from the portals as I once did, " + "but I've manged to enslave ever-more powerful and destructive beasts. The stalkers, the lumbering behemoths and the curiously noble Kal'Gerions are all creatures of my will now, defending", "my great work as if it were their own.

One of my portals malfunctioned and a race of troublesome creatures crept through without me noticing. " + "They refer to themselves as the gorajo and they maneuvered against me from the very start; their culture despises the reanimation of the dead and the summoning of demons, it seems. " + "The backward fools. While my powers are great, they have a habit of keeping out", "of sight, so I fear this will be a long fight. <br> Zamorak guide me!"),

Bah! I rename it The Age of Reckoning! " + "I will allow the humans three hours to celebrate, and then we work again. I will not allow them any longer than that: revelry leads to rebellion, and I cannot afford to massacre them as we get so close. <br> Zamorak be praised!"),

The area below is weaker than the bedrock I have been forging through, and my magic carves through it like saw through flesh.

Vile trickery... <br> I, Bilrach, will find this Rift, where the barrier between realms", "thins. <br> " + "I, Bilrach, will re-open it and release my Master upon this world once more. <br> I, Bilrach, will release Zamorak!"),

Their elders and children will pay for their misdeeds. I vow, here and now, that I will sunder their world with the power " + "I acquire at the bottom of this place. Blast them and their cowardly raids, their burning of the beams and struts, and their plundering of our resources. Zamorak be praised, Gorajo be damned!"),

I have found methods to push faster and farther; my portals rip through floors like never before, and anything " + "I leave behind is dumped as waste in the gorajo realm. Let their families pay the price for their warriors slowing me down! " + "I grin to think of the welcome they'll be given by their families when they return home.", "Zamorak be praised!"),

I am but a few years from the end; yet, I fear the progress will be slow. So much of my power is spent defensively, " + "propping up the floors that threaten to crash down upon me. The floors above are warped, out of control and dangerously unstable. I have trouble containing them, so, instead, " + "I have chose to protect just myself. That being said, what followers", "I left behind are now lost to corruption, and I fear that a foe will rise that even I could not deal with.

" + "These demons were already an army when they were contacted by our Master. After a brief demonstration of his power, their leader, Kal'Ger the Warmonger pledged allegiance to our Master, " + "and began ordering his armies as he instructed. The rank and file Kal'Gerion demons", "are essentially lesser and greater demons as the rest of the world knows them. The significant " + "Kal'Gerions are the generals in the army. The one known as To'Kash has great magical powers, and can manipulate moisture and temperature levels in his environment. " + "He has been stationed in the cold upper levels of the dungeons, where he can make most use of his powers - with the amount of cold moisture already in the air, he can encase anything in a " + "large block of ice", "with a mere snap of his demonic fingers.

Date unknown. <br> The Kal'Gerion army has a very simple military structure: Kal'Ger is the leader, his five generals immediately below him, and the lesser and " + "greater demons make up the rank-and-file fodder. These order themselves by strength, constantly battling for supremacy, competing to rank the highest amongst the lowest. " + "One general in the Kal'Gerion army is Har'Lakk, known as the Riftsplitter. This demon uses portals", "to other planes in a very interesting and unorthodox way. " + "The one time I witnessed him fight, he opened a portal in the ground of this plane to the point above an erupting volcano in another, and the explosion of flames, ash and magma, " + "incinerated his opponent effortlessly. This ingenious and unpredictable use of portal magic makes him a highly effective combatant. He can control his combat environment and create deadly " + "hazards for his opponents at will,", "making the ground beneath them as much their enemy as Har'Lakk himself."),

He smashes things with his two", "huge hammers, as hard and as fast as he can. His blows are so powerful and the rage running through him so fierce, " + "that his hammer blows carve cracks in the ground, out of which bubbling magma and noxious fumes rise.

The more powerful demons, meanwhile, know that they cannot be bested in one-on-one battle, so taunt and belittle the " + "smaller demons, goading them into fighting each other. I think of one Kal'Gerion as", "I write this, Yk'Lagor the Thunderous, who thinned his ranks by forcing them to kill each other, " + "and then demanded new troops to be brought in from the Kal'Gerion realm.
